# ClassificationwithCNN
In this project I implemented a CNN model (Convolutional Neural Network) on an image dataset for Classification.
First, Some preprocessing, common when using image datasets, was done on the images, such as resizing. At last, accuracy of the model's performance was assessed to make sure the model was trained efficiently.
